# DBMS_FleurDeDaphne_
The phase of designing the DBMS is broken down into 3 critical steps. The listed engineers will take the system requirements and begin creating the ER model in UML notation. Next, they will take the model one step further by transforming the ER model into a Relational model. Finally, the engineers will Normalize the model, making sure that there are strong dependencies in the relations and the normalizations are all satisfactory of the 3NF form. After the design work is completed, the engineers can move onto the implementation phase. 
During the implementation phase, the engineers use their programming and critical thinking skills to create the SQL schema using SQL code. After the SQL schema is created, the engineers can finally develop the Database Application.
